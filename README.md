cache : (searching )

if search something new ,we are checking that are available in store or not ,
    if there we are declining API call ,
    if not there in store   - then we are calling API  and we are updating the   new data in store

time complexity to search in array  = O(n)
time complexity to search in Object = O(1)

[i,ip,iph,iphone] -O(n)

{
    i:
    ip:
    iph:
    ipgone
} 
-O(1)
